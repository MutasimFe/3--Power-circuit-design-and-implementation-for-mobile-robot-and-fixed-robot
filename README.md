# 3-Power circuit design and implementation for mobile robot and fixed robot

# The Main Idea Of This Task: 

This task is devided into 3 sub-tasks which are related to each other. 


In this task I:


1. I choose which battery is the best battery for the fighter robot.

2. Since the chosen battery must be a rechargeable battery, I made the electrical circuit of charging the chosen battery.

3. Last I connected the circuit of the previous task ( 2 dc motors ) with the charging circuit. 



# (1) Chosing Battery:

## Components of the circuit: 

In this section i will define the operating voltages/currents of all components that is using in the Fighter Robot. 

1. Arduino:

        The operating voltage: 5v (most common) or 3.3V

        The operating current: 20mA per I/O port
        
        The totale current of all pins: 200mA 
       
2. DC Motors x4: 

    Dc motors are not specified by a specific type so I will take the average operation current at 6-12 voltages.
    
        The operating voltage: 6-12V 

        The operating current: 300mA-1.2A
        
        The total current consumption: i will take the average (1200-300)/2 * 4 = 1800mA = 1.8A
       
       

3. L298N Dual H-Bridgle x2:

        The operating voltage: 5-35voltage but 5 voltage will be considered in our robot

        The operating current: 36mA
        
        The totale current consumption:  36mA*2 = 72mA

4. Servo Motors x5:

        The operating voltage: 4.2-7V usually at 6V

        The operating current: 350-450mA 
        
        The totale current consumption: i will consider the avergae current which is 400*5 = 2000mA = 2A

## Maximum Voltage and Total Current: 

So, the total current of all components are: 
 
        200mA + 1.8A + 72mA + 2A = 4072 mA which approximately equal to 4A

*Note that: this total current is upon my assumption which means it can be larger or smaller but approximately around it.

The maximum voltage used is:

        12v

## Life Time: 

   The life time of the battery is basically can be calculated using this follow farmula:

        Time = Total Battery Supply (mAH) / Total Current Consumption (mA) ; the total current is known above and the time is set by the developer 
        
   So, since the project is a fighter robot which means the life time of batter doesnt have to be so long and in my openioin 3 hours are enough
   
   Thus, the Total Battery Supply (mAH) must be:
   
        Total Battery Supply(mAH) = 3hours * 4000mA = 12000 mAh

## Main Constraints Of Chosing Battery: 

From above we know that the two main constraints that must be conderated in chosing the battery are:

1. The maximum voltage is: 12V

2. Total Battery Supply(mAH) = 12000mAh

## The Chosen Battery:

If i want to make a battery that provide 12 voltage and 12Ah i have two ways to get:
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1- i will connect individual batteries to get these values

I have chosen the Li-ion battery because of Li-ion batteries are able to be recharged hundreds of times and are more stable. They tend to have a higher energy density, voltage capacity and lower self-discharge rate than other rechargeable batteries. This makes for better power efficiency as a single cell has longer charge retention than other battery types. 

But remember this type of battery is expensive which is the main disadvantage.

**But remember it's worth for all its characteristics**

In this case i will chose one of two battries **18650 - MJ1** or **18650 - 35E** 
        
![600x601](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123690920-a6630f00-d85d-11eb-854b-65d425171c95.png)
![8d00fe7c-053e-4744-993a-85cef1662b9f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123690903-a19e5b00-d85d-11eb-97f4-15b1eeec260c.jpg)


   Each of them provides: **3.7V** and **3500mAh** for each single cell
         
   So to have 12 volt with 12Ah i will connect:
         
   following the same concept of following figure:   
         
![BatteriesWiredSeriesParallel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123692468-83d1f580-d85f-11eb-8ad9-5b942d02c39a.jpg)
         
   1. Connect 4 cells in series to increase the voltage, thus will give me 4*3.7 = 14.8V
   
   2. Connect four of 14.8 voltage in parallel to have the mAh, thus we will have 4*3500= 14mAh; which is even more than required for 3 hours

   I can use **26650A battery** as well and the arrangement would not be exactly the same

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2-Using a existing battries:
This is an easier way and it will eliminate us from making a charging circuit because it will have a charger too.

# (2) Charging Circuit:

## Diagram 

I designed the charging circuit ass following figure

but sadly I am not familiar with the advanced simulation platforms and the available simulation platforms are not supporting all equipment so I used the Circuit Diagram platform for drawing the electrical circuit, and when I get familiar with the advanced platform I will the connection to make sure that the circuit is working successfully.

## Notes and Explanation The Diagram

note* the description would be from left to right

1. Transformer

   I used a transformer to reduce the voltage into a usable voltage.

![transformer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123964352-01127d00-d9bc-11eb-8394-447e8230a0cd.png)

2. Full-Wave Recifier

   Then I used a full-wave rectifier to convert the AC voltage into DC voltage, and also it is following with 10mH inductor and 100Î¼F for smoothing the DC voltage.

3. LM371

  Which is the voltage regulator giving a constant dc voltage; it works by changing the resistors to have the wanter voltage.
  
   ![05d98d87588bfbdc0d2b2fca8df16f0f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123970088-80567f80-d9c1-11eb-9f62-f03fd34e50cc.png)

  The diodes are mostly for protections
  
4. Zened diodes
   
   Zener diodes are for protection and regulate the voltage too.

# (3) Full Circuit 

In connection, I only added a voltage regulator since the voltage of the battery is 14.8v to make it 12v which is the maximum voltage of dc motors. However, it can be controlled by the potentiometer.

![Second Task - Motor drive design and implementation for two-wheel robot base (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85455361/123978349-77b57780-d9c8-11eb-802d-6453c7839f0c.png)

## Important Notes!

1. The connection above is to have the general idea of connection 

2. There is no LM371 voltage regulator in TINKERCAD so i used the LM7805 just to show the idea.

3. Same for battries there is no li-ion battries.
        
4. The connection is for connecting DC motors with the battries, but the designed battries are done to serve all components in the fighter robot.

5. The battery is supplying 12 volt for the circkuit but i can use resistor to control the voltages for each components.
